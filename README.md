# Machine Learning CAS Module 3

### Description
Using Zalando dataset for tensorflow classification with a Neuronal network as a practice to recognize clothes, before starting to do the same but with berries.

### Tested images

For the sake of the practice I used 3 of my desired images to test if the model will be able to somehow recognize uncentred but ```28x28``` images.

#### My first image would be a flat sneaker
